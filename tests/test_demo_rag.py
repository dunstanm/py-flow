Mirror test for demo_rag.py
==============================
Verifies the full demo flow:

  1. Upload financial documents (auto-chunk + embed)
  2. Search three ways: full-text, semantic, hybrid
  3. RAG: ask questions grounded in documents
  4. Structured extraction from text
  5. Direct generation + streaming
  6. Tool calling: LLM searches autonomously

        Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial derivatives that allow investors
        to transfer credit risk. The buyer of a CDS makes periodic payments to the
        seller and receives a payoff if a credit event occurs on the reference entity.

        CDS spreads reflect the market's perception of credit risk. A wider spread
        indicates higher perceived default probability. The CDS market grew rapidly
        before the 2008 financial crisis and played a significant role in the
        systemic risk that led to the collapse of major financial institutions.

        exposures. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requires sufficient
        high-quality liquid assets to cover 30-day net cash outflows.

        Interest Rate Swap Valuation

        An interest rate swap (IRS) exchanges fixed-rate payments for floating-rate
        payments on a notional principal. Valuation involves:

        1. Discount factors derived from the yield curve
        2. Forward rates for projecting floating leg cash flows
        3. Present value of fixed leg minus present value of floating leg

        The swap rate is the fixed rate that makes the swap NPV equal to zero
        at inception. DV01 (dollar value of a basis point) measures sensitivity
        to a 1bp parallel shift in the yield curve.

        Common day count conventions: ACT/360 for floating, 30/360 for fixed.
        Payment frequencies: quarterly floating, semi-annual fixed.

        Mark-to-market P&L = current NPV minus inception NPV.

        Portfolio Risk Metrics

        Value at Risk (VaR) estimates the maximum expected loss over a given
        time horizon at a specified confidence level. A 1-day 99% VaR of $5M
        means there is a 1% chance of losing more than $5M in one day.

        Expected Shortfall (ES), also called CVaR, measures the average loss
        in the worst X% of cases. ES is considered a more coherent risk measure
        than VaR because it satisfies subadditivity.

        Stress testing involves hypothetical or historical scenarios:
        - 2008 Financial Crisis replay
        - +200bp parallel rate shock
        - Equity market crash (-30%)
        - Credit spread widening (+500bp)
